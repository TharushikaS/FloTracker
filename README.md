## 🔍 Why I Selected This Topic

Menstrual health is a vital aspect of women's overall well-being, yet it's often overlooked or under-discussed. I chose this topic to provide a **private**, **intuitive**, and **empowering** tool for people who menstruate to track their cycles, monitor symptoms, and gain personalized insights into their health. With FloTracker, I aim to contribute to breaking the stigma and promoting self-awareness and wellness.
